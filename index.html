<h2> Lights Down Low </h2>
She said I'm going too fast, take it slow
So I slapped her on the ass, start pullin' on her hair
She nibbles on my ear like boy it's good
She love the way I'm tellin' how a nigga keep it hood
Give it to me daddy, that's what she keeps screamin, give it to me daddy
She love the way I beat it
She wish that I can repeat it
I got her in a trance
Man I'm even fuckin friends
Got 'her blowing like the wind
She's shaking, got me impatient
Back and forth pacin', man I need my medication
Lights down low so we gettin' naughty
Making fuck faces, she ride me like a Harley
Take it slow, put it down on me
I said jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, time to, time to get naughty
Take it slow, put it down on me
Baby jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, lights down low
